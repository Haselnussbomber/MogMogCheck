# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

- **Changed:** The tooltip for Triple Triad cards has been completely revised to make the values easier to read. It also fixes the fourth and fifth stars being swapped and the left and bottom values being swapped.
- **Fixed:** The item name didn't update when the language was changed in the Dalamud Settings.

## [2.2.2] (2024-10-08)

Update for Dawntrail.

## [2.2.1] (2024-03-20)

The target framework has been updated to .NET 8, some code has been adjusted to take advantage of the additions it brings, and the NoAlloq dependency was removed.

No further changes on the plugin itself.

## [2.2.0] (2024-03-10)

**Update for The Second Hunt for Genesis.**  
The rewards list *should* automatically switch over to the new items whenever the second hunt starts.  

- **Added:** A new configuration option was added to hide previous seasons (default on).  
  Reason: The game data lists all items in a single exchange shop. This option hides items using Irregular Tomestone of Genesis I whenever the second hunt starts.

## [2.1.1] (2024-02-10)

- **Fixed:** The barding unlock checkmark didn't work properly.

## [2.1.0] (2024-02-04)

- **Added:** A context menu for the required quest icon was added with an option to open the quest on Garland Tools DB.
- **Changed:** The tomestone icon and quantity in the "Tomestones Required" column will be darkened if you have fewer tombstones than needed for that item.
- **Fixed:** In the Triple Triad Cards tooltip, the fourth and fifth stars were on opposite sides.

## [2.0.1] (2024-01-30)

- **Fixed:** Tomestone count was always 0.
- **Fixed:** Window open sound would play twice when MogMogCheck was opened with Mogpendium.

## [2.0.0] (2024-01-26)

**Update for The First Hunt for Genesis.**  
I did my best to have this plugin updated prior to the start of the event. Please enjoy!

- **Added:** A configuration window was added, accessible via Dalamuds Plugin Installer, the `/mogmog config` command, or via the cogwheel in the title bar of the MogMogCheck window. It allows you to change the following new settings:
  - Open/Close with Mogpendium (default: on)
  - Enable/disable Checkbox-Mode (default: on): The Checkbox-Mode is the default behaviour for MogMogCheck, as it was before the update. It displays a checkbox next to the items, that you can click to track the required tomestones. When Checkbox-Mode is off, it displays a slider instead. Non-unique items can be purchased multiple times, so if you want to track more than one of an item, you can now do so.
- **Added:** The context menu for equippable items now has a "Try on" option.
- **Changed:** Item icon tooltips for Triple Triad Cards now mimic the card style, displaying their stars and stats.
- **Changed:** Items that become available for exchange once you have completed a quest now display the map marker icon. The tooltips have also been improved. Both now indicate whether a quest is complete/incomplete.
- **Removed:** The Duties tab has been removed due to the introduction of the Mogpendium.
- **Fixed:** Item names and quest titles are now respecting the language selected in Dalamud instead of using the client's language.

## [1.1.1] (2023-10-04)

Update for Patch 6.5.

## [1.1.0] (2023-08-30)

- **Added:** Hovering over an item icon in the rewards table will now show a preview for emotes, fashion accessories, hairstyles, minions, mounts, paintings, and Triple Triad cards. Otherwise, just a slightly larger icon.
- **Added:** The Rewards column in the Duties table now shows the amount for wins, losses, and ties for PvP Duties.

## [1.0.3] (2023-08-29)
