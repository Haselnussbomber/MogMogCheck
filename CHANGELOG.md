## [2.2.0] (2024-03-10)

**Update for The Second Hunt for Genesis.**  
The rewards list *should* automatically switch over to the new items whenever the second hunt starts.  

- **Added:** A new configuration option was added to hide previous seasons (default on).  
  Reason: The game data lists all items in a single exchange shop. This option hides items using Irregular Tomestone of Genesis I whenever the second hunt starts.

## [2.1.1] (2024-02-10)

- **Fixed:** The barding unlock checkmark didn't work properly.

## [2.1.0] (2024-02-04)

- **Fixed:** Tomestone count was always 0.
- **Fixed:** Window open sound would play twice when MogMogCheck was opened with Mogpendium.

## [2.0.0] (2024-01-26)

**Update for The First Hunt for Genesis.**  
I did my best to have this plugin updated prior to the start of the event. Please enjoy!

- **Added:** A configuration window was added, accessible via Dalamuds Plugin Installer, the `/mogmog config` command, or via the cogwheel in the title bar of the MogMogCheck window. It allows you to change the following new settings:
  - Open/Close with Mogpendium (default: on)
  - Enable/disable Checkbox-Mode (default: on): The Checkbox-Mode is the default behaviour for MogMogCheck, as it was before the update. It displays a checkbox next to the items, that you can click to track the required tomestones. When Checkbox-Mode is off, it displays a slider instead. Non-unique items can be purchased multiple times, so if you want to track more than one of an item, you can now do so.
- **Added:** The context menu for equippable items now has a "Try on" option.
- **Changed:** Item icon tooltips for Triple Triad Cards now mimic the card style, displaying their stars and stats.
- **Changed:** Items that become available for exchange once you have completed a quest now display the map marker icon. The tooltips have also been improved. Both now indicate whether a quest is complete/incomplete.
- **Removed:** The Duties tab has been removed due to the introduction of the Mogpendium.
- **Fixed:** Item names and quest titles are now respecting the language selected in Dalamud instead of using the client's language.

## [1.1.1] (2023-10-04)

Update for Patch 6.5.

## [1.1.0] (2023-08-30)

- **Added:** Hovering over an item icon in the rewards table will now show a preview for emotes, fashion accessories, hairstyles, minions, mounts, paintings, and Triple Triad cards. Otherwise, just a slightly larger icon.
- **Added:** The Rewards column in the Duties table now shows the amount for wins, losses, and ties for PvP Duties.

## [1.0.3] (2023-08-29)
