# MogMogCheck

**MogMogCheck** is a small plugin to assist you in tracking the rewards of the Moogle Treasure Trove event (called Mog Mog Kollektion in German, hence the name).

Open with `/mogmog`.

The Rewards tab lists items of the "Newest ... Tomestone Exchange" shop with their collection status and price.  
You can also check the boxes to keep track of how many Tomestones you need at the top.

The Duties tab lists all the duties that reward Tomestones for the event.  
Clicking on a duty will open the Duty Finder with that duty selected.

Technically it should automatically update with each event, as they seem to replace the same shop every time (meaning the shop id is always the same).
