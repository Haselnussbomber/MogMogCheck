# MogMogCheck

**MogMogCheck** is a small plugin to assist you in tracking the rewards of the Moogle Treasure Trove event (called Mog Mog Kollektion in German, hence the name).

This plugin is only available via my custom repository:  
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Haselnussbomber/MyDalamudPlugins/main/repo.json

MogMogCheck automatically opens with the Mogpendium. Alternatively, you can open it with the `/mogmog` command.  
Simply tick the checkboxes of the items you want to track and it shows you how many tomestones you still need to farm!

The configuration can be opened with the cog-button in the title bar, with the `/mogmog config` command, or via the Dalamud Plugin Installer.

It allows you to change the following settings:

- Open/Close with Mogpendium (default: on)
- Enable/Disable Checkbox-Mode (default: on): The Checkbox-Mode displays a checkbox next to the items, that you can click to track the required tomestones. When Checkbox-Mode is off, it displays a slider instead. Non-unique items can be purchased multiple times, so if you want to track more than one of an item, you can now do so.
