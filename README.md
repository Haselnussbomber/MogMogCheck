**MogMogCheck** is a small plugin to assist you in tracking the rewards of the Moogle Treasure Trove event.<br/>
<br/>
<hr>

This plugin is available in the Dalamud plugin repository!

MogMogCheck automatically opens with the Mogpendium. Alternatively, you can open it with the `/mogmog` command.

Simply tick the checkboxes of the items you want to track and it shows you how many tomestones you still need to farm!

And if you disable the Checkbox-Mode in the settings, you can track non-unique items multiple times:

The configuration can be opened with the cog-button in the title bar, with the `/mogmog config` command, or via the Dalamud Plugin Installer, and contains the following settings:

- Open/Close with Mogpendium (default: on)
- Open/Close with Shop window (default: on)
- Enable/Disable Checkbox-Mode (default: on): This mode displays a checkbox, so that you simply track an items required tomestones. When Checkbox-Mode is off however, it displays a slider instead. This is useful for non-unique items which can be purchased multiple times, for example the MGP Card.
  - Automatically turn off tracking for purchased rewards (default: on)
- Gray out collected items (default: off)
